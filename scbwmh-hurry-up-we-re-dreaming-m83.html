We and our partners use cookies to personalize your experience, to show you ads based on your interests, and for measurement and analytics purposes. Haunting and mesmerizing, 'Hurry Up, We're Dreaming' is simply the best work of Electronica I have ever heard. Unlike much of the music in that category it never goes over the top with its beats or vocals but stays happily mellow and yet never gets boring. Since 2003's Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, M83 mastermind Anthony Gonzalez has created increasingly colossal records. His latest, a double album that serves as a framework to realize the marvelous capability of our dreams and daily lives, could be his best record. M83's cinematic tendencies come to a head on French musician Anthony Gonzalez's sixth album. Zola Jesus' turn on "Intro" sets the scene like a cliff dive filmed in sparkling slow motion, and "Midnight City" amps up the synth-pop drama with soaring vocals and volleys of electronic drums.
